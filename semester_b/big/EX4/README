palindrom from the start and then the first palindrom for the last place. 
if the program didnt found a match it prints the numer 0 in each place 

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4a.cc -o ex4a

This program ask for a numebr 1 or 0 to find oyut what the user want to do. 
and then there are a few options initializing the array print the arr sorting 
the array with bubler sort read another or exut the frogram. each one does 
different things. the initializing gets numebrs Date or Time until -1 is 
put to him. print prints all the data put in to him. sort is sorting the 
array by numebr from small to big. read another gets anothe time or date. 
and exit realsing the array that has been used and exit the program 

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4c.cc ex4c_given.cc -o ex4c
Run: ./ex4c


input: at the begginng 1 or 0 for date or time, and the number from 1-4 for 
       the programs that i wrote above

output: only the print has an put put of the artray that the user put in
