This program gets to files from the user and does only one this with it. 
It take the file that needs to be encrypted and cheks every single char in 
it to see if it needs to be replaced (The chars that need to be replaced 
are only letters and letetrs that are found in pairs in the key file that 
program got from the user). each letter is cheked in the key file if it found
his pair it print the other letter of the pair if not it prints the current 
one.
It does that to the entire file.
Every time the program prints it print it to the terminal as well as the file

This program gets to files. To each one of them it countes how many latters 
are in the file and puts it with the letter in 2 diffrent arrays. Then it 
sorts them with a buble sort. each time it move the number it moves the letter 
to to keep the letter with the number it shoed in the array. For example the 
most letter in the file will be at place number one in the array and so on. 
Then The program need to switch the letters fore one file to another. 
The letter with the most appereances in one file will switch with the letter 
with th e most appereance letter in the other file. If 2 letters have the 
same amount of appereances it prints the letters acording to the abc.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex0b.cc -o ex0b
Run: ./ex0b

input: 2 files one to chage and one to count the letters

output: print of the decript file to the terminal

only it grades. if the names are not similar it prints the line which goes 
first on the abc. When it finishes one of the files it prints all the other 
file.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex0c.cc -o ex0c
Run: ./ex0c
