The number of organs on the list that are larger than their predecessors 
and smaller than their successors

This program get numbers from the user and checks each one of them if the 
number before it is smaller then him and the number after him is bigger 
them him. only if those two options exist it adds one to the counter. 
at the end it prints the amount. to check the first number and the last on 
one of the things needs to work acordingly.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex2a.cc -o ex2a
Run: ./ex2a

input: numbers until eof

output: how much numbers how many numbers where the condition is met

skips in a circle
========================================

This program builds a list that goes in both ways. first iit reads and id and 
jump to each node it creates and then conting each one to the next and back 
node. the program gets numebrs to the nodes and put it it pairs the first 
num goes to the id and the second one goes to the jump. the program stops 
getting numbers when the second number is 0. the it prints the id of the first 
node and jumps the amount of numebrs that the jumps says. forword or backwords 
even a complete circel. when it jumped enoth times the program print the id on 
the node that it is corrently in and jumps again. it does that until we went 
to the node with the jump = 0 or it jumped 15 times. 

Compile: g++ -Wall ex2b.cc -o ex2b
Run: ./ex2b

input: pairs of numebrs until the second one is 0

output: the id of the nodes after the jumps

List of lists by minimum divisions
========================================

This program builds to list and concting between them. the first list is a 
prime numbers list it gets the numebrs to therte or by the user or if the user 
puts a number that is not prime it find its smalles dividened (that is a prime)
and put it in order of smallest to biggest. the second list is a numebr the 
the user put in. each numebr is conctted to its prime number on the left. it 
out it in the right line near the prime numebr that it belong to at the end. 
for example the numebr 15 is not a prime but the smallest dividened of him is 
the numebr 3. so it build the prime number node 3 and concets the numebr 15 
in the right side of him. 

Compile: g++ -Wall ex2c.cc -o ex2c
Run: ./ex2c


input: number bigger the 2 until the number 0

output: the main prime number and then all the numebr that the user put in
