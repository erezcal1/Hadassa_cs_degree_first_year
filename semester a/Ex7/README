This program gets 2 arrays one after the other and does with them two things.
one is to taker the first array and  print the small letter in caps and big 
and keep the like they are the program dosent print any other things like ! 
and @.
after the program prints all those things it moves to its second task witch 
is to eliminate all the letters and symbols found in the first array for 
example if the first array was 123abc and the second array was 123ab the print
 will only be c


Compile: g++ -Wall ex7a.cc -o ex7a
Run: ./ex7a

to the number she doose a couple of things 1. is to move every letter random 
number of steps(acording to what it randomize at the begining) steps forword 
in the abc 2. mirror the word again according to the number for example if it 
randomize the number 4 it mirror the letter every 3 values in the string. 3. 
adding a random latters in the string. if you chose to decrip it does al the 
thing but in backword order: removing the random added letters, mirroring the 
letters back and the at the end it moves back the letter to they supose to be.
when you decript the number that is used to do all then thing is the last 
digit you put in the string.
