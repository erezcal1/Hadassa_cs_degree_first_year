finding Equilateral triangles in a two-dimensional array
========================================
written by: Erez Calderon, Id: 318993847, LogIn: erezca

This program gets an array with 10 rows and 15 coloms and find if and where 
there are tringles. if there are tringles it prints where they start and how 
big are they if they are inverted or not, and at the end or the program 
cheking the array it priints the biggest tringle and if there is more then 
one it prints how much tiringles like this exist.
The run time is ROWS * (COLS)^2 * base_of_triangle


Compile: g++ -Wall ex6b.cc -o ex6b
Run: ./ex6b

input: an array with 10 rows and 15 coloms

output: The tringles that the program find and how much of the biggest
