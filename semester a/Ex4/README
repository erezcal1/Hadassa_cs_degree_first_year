This program gets 6 numbers in an arry and show how much values in the arry.
It prtints the number that divide by the previus arry without a remainder left 
and divide the nuimber after them without a remainder left too.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4a.cc -o ex4a
Run: ./ex4a

input: 6 numbers in arry

output: number that divide the last number and the number after in order

This program gets 12 numbers 3 for the first arry and 9 for the second.
It prints  the first number that start the wich the first arry is located in.
The first arry needs to be in the same order without any inturaptuins if the program 
dosent find arry 1 in the second arry it pronts -1.

Compile: g++ -Wall ex4b.cc -o ex4b
Run: ./ex4b

input: arry 1: 3 numbers, arry 2: 9 numbers.

This program is locating a loop and prints the numbers the loop has been
========================================

This program gets 8 numbers and finds a loop that accepet the following order:
the first arry points at a number then this number points at an arry that has the same number as the one insert to arry one.
it gose like this until it finds an arry for example the arry 3 that have the nu,ber 5 points at an arry that have the number 6, 
this poits at an arry 6 that hve the number 3 and we go back to the srat and thats how we finished a loop.
If the program dosent find a loop it prints


Compile: g++ -Wall ex4c.cc -o ex4c
Run: ./ex4c


input: 8 numbers in to an arry 

output: what number are in ther loop if there is no loop its nbot printing anything
